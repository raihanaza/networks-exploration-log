# Navigating the Internet Seas
## Morgan's Log

### 7 Feb 2025
Seems that I overslept last night...I do not know where I am! The waves of the Internet Seas must have knocked me out and set me off track from the route I was heading. No worries. I shall fear not as I am Captain Morgan, fearless explorer of this digital landscape.

It is truly incredible here. Messages travel at breakneck speeds, unseen but ever-present, like the wind guiding a ship’s sail. I do not yet have a map to guide me, but that shall be my task. I will explore these mysterious lands, chart their paths, and document my findings for future sailors of the digital world. This vast, interconnected Internet sea shall soon be revealed, and I, Captain Morgan, shall be its first great navigator. 🗺️

#### Ship Preparation 
As I venture into uncharted territory, I need take note of my surroundings. This area shall be home base, as I am unfamiliar with nothing else.
